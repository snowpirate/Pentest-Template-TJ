## Introduction (original)
As a pentester, there are many great resources, cheat sheets, and guidelines that contain a large amount of valuable 
information. However, it can be frustrating and time-consuming to find these notes or resources that are scattered all 
over the place. Not to mention the large amount of notes you have stored locally across your system with several 
different note-taking tools. In addition, some pentesters could be in assessments that are in a closed environment 
making it more challenging to transfer there notes and files on their devices. 

## A Word of Advice: (original)
This template contains a variety of tools, commands, and resources that I reference from to use for certain cases when 
I am on an engagement. However, it is important that you learn about these tools and understand the references being 
used! Take some time to look over the resources I put in before you start running these tools or commands blindly. If 
the tool or command does not work the way it should, then take a step back and troubleshoot it. **Critical thinking** 
is a necessary skill that all pentesters need to have when they are assessing a variety of options to make a better 
informed decision.
